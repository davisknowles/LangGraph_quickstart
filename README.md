LangGraph_quickstart
Here are the core ideas behind each LangGraph topic you listed:

1. Start with a prebuilt agent

* LangGraph ships “prebuilt” agents (e.g., a ReAct-style tool-calling agent) so you can stand up a working chatbot quickly, then customize later. Use `create_react_agent` and supply your model + tools; you get sane defaults for routing messages, tool calls, and turn management. ([GitHub][1])

2. Build a custom workflow (Overview)

* LangGraph apps are graphs: nodes (LLM calls, tools, functions) and edges (control flow). You can start from the prebuilt agent and progressively replace/extend nodes to match your business logic—adding state, guards, review steps, and recovery paths. (This is the framing used throughout the LangGraph “how-to” docs and quickstarts.) ([Langchain AI][2])

3. Add tools

* Tools are callable functions the agent can invoke. You register them and the prebuilt agent handles tool-call planning/execution and integrates outputs back into the conversation state. Tools can be anything (search, databases, APIs). ([LangChain][3])

4. Add memory

* Memory = state across turns. LangGraph supports (a) short-term conversation memory inside the graph state for multi-turn context, and (b) long-term memory persisted to a store (e.g., DB) for user- or app-level recall. You control what to save, when to trim, and how to retrieve. ([LangChain Docs][4])

5. Add human-in-the-loop

* Insert checkpoints where a person can review/approve tool calls, edit model outputs, provide missing info, or correct course. LangGraph provides patterns and APIs to pause, request input, and resume the graph reliably. This improves safety and quality for LLM workflows. ([LangChain Docs][5])

6. Customize state

* The “state” is your single source of truth for the graph (messages, tool results, metadata, memory keys). You define the schema and update rules so every node reads/writes the parts it owns—making the system debuggable and composable. (Shown across LangGraph docs and tool-integration examples.) ([LangChain][3])

7. Time travel

* Via checkpointing, you can replay past states and even branch from earlier points to explore alternative paths—useful for debugging, audits, and “version-controlling” conversations. You can reset to a prior checkpoint and re-run with changes. ([Baihezi][6])
